A small, somewhat barebones app that makes accessing a large excel sheet with a LOT of rows easy.

Main functionality provided within the app includes:
- Searching up a name, and finding associated "communities"
- Getting a list of names or emails of individuals involved within a "community"

This really is more of an excercise in automation and serves as a way for me to brush up on Python and learn about Textual.
There's more to be done, but for now it has some functionality and (sometimes) doesn't crash.
