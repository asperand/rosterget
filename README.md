A small app that makes accessing a large excel sheet with a LOT of rows easy.

Main functionality provided within the app includes:
- Searching up a name, and finding associated "communities"
- Getting a list of names or emails of individuals involved within a "community"

There's more to be done, but for now it has barebones functionality and (sometimes) doesn't crash.
